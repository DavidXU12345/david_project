All of my personal projects in Python and C++ are saved here for your reference.

## 1. HSI Prediction
I applied KNN algorithm to predict Hang Seng Index trend by using features "Open-Close" and "High-Low" and picked up k=15 which is the optimal parameter. By using back test, this simple "buy low, sell high" trading strategy can give me over 30% extra return compared to Hang Seng Index itself for past three years.

## 2. KNN Classifier
It is a school project that I wrote KNN algorithm to classify three classes of wines without using any machine learning Python packages. I also applied nested cross-validation to choose best number of neighbours and distance calculation method (Euclidean or Manhattan). I used confusion matrix, accuracy rate, precision and recall to evaluate the machine learning results.

## 3. Yahoo News Web Scrapping and Data Analysis
I used beautiful soup to get information from Yahoo news including news title, descriptions, source, time, links. I also applied sentiment analysis to give sentiment scores for each searching results and present them in a visualized way.

## 4. Sudoku Solver
I built a sudoku solver using backtracking algorithm.

## 5. Tic Tac Toe Game
I built an undefeatable AI to play Tic Tac Toe game using minimax algorithm.
